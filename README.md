# Mars Photo Album :rocket:

This project raisees awareness of NASA's presence on Mars. 

It educates the user about the data we have available to us and about the technology used to acquire the data. It pulls from two APIs, [NASA's Mars Rover Photos Viewer](https://github.com/chrisccerami/mars-photo-api) for the Mars photos, and from [NASA's Mars Weather Service API](https://api.nasa.gov/assets/insight/InSight%20Weather%20API%20Documentation.pdf)for the weather widget.

This project uses Python, Flask, Axios, SQLAlchemy, CSS, and HTML. 

I chose Flask to write my routes, Axios to make my calls, SQALchemy to build my database, and Jinja templates to pick up the variables from my routes and create functionality in my HTML. I used CSS Bootstrap to smooth out the styling.

Please enjoy clicking around to see how I wrote my routes, models, forms, testing, and templates.
