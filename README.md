# Mars Photo Album :rocket:

This project raisees awareness of NASA's presence on Mars. 

It educates the user about the data we have available to us and about the technology used to acquire the data. It pulls from two APIs, [NASA's Mars Rover Photos Viewer](https://github.com/chrisccerami/mars-photo-api) for the Mars photos, and from [NASA's Mars Weather Service API](https://api.nasa.gov/assets/insight/InSight%20Weather%20API%20Documentation.pdf)for the weather widget.

This project uses Python, CSS, and HTML. Please enjoy clicking around to see how I wrote my routes, models, forms, testing, and templates.
